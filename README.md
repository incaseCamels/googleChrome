# googleChromeUpdateChecker

The reason for this is because you may have set Chrome to automatically update, but it requires a relaunch and you haven't seen the icon. A balloon may be more in your face. 

Perhaps it hasn't called out for a new update check yet and your scheduled job will beat it. 

The API call here is cheap for Google, and cheap for you. 

It will relaunch Chrome for you, if you have only the one Chrome browser open, it's very likely it will tell you Chrome closed weirdly and unexpectedly and it will allow you to restore your tabs.
